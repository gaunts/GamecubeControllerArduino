# Gamecube Controller Arduino Extension Cable

This repo hosts the source code to run on an arduino used with a gamecube extension cable.  
It  renders any stock gamecube controller tournament viable by improving back dashes, allowing shield drops and correcting up-b angles.  

The code is inspired by the one made by Hax and modified to suit my preferences.

Custom controls:

- down + b : Toggles everything, your controller will work as normal.
- down + a : Toggles dashback and shielddrop fixes. Dows not affect vector fixes.
- down + y : Toggles dolphin mode. Dolphin is a gamecube emulator for PC.
